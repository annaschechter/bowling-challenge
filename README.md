Makers Academy challenge week5

In this project I will be making a system for counting and suming up the scores of a bowling game of one player(in javascript).

The system will have the following functionality:

* the game consists of 10 frames
* each frame consists of one or two throws depending on the throw outcome
* the number of knocked down pins is represented by points
* if 10 pins(max available for a roll) are knocked down in the first roll it's a strike
	The frame ends immediately (since there are no pins left for a second roll).
	The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next two rolls. That is the next frame, except if the player rolls a strike again.
* if 10 pins are knocked down in two rolls it's a spare
	The player has a spare if the knocks down all 10 pins with the two rolls of a frame. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll (first role of next frame).
